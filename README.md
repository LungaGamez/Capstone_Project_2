# How it works

In order to run this Simple Game program, you must install the Python interpreter program, and Pygame onto your computer's operating system
Link to download the appropriate Python version for your OS (e.g. Windows, Mac, Linux etc.) https://www.python.org/downloads/
Link as a guide to using Python's Installer Program (PIP) to install Pygame, https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted
Once Python and Pygame are installed, you can run the code using IDLE programme file(automatically downloads with the Python program files). IDLE is an Integrated Development Environment that allows you to read and execute codes.
Once IDLE is opened it will display a "Shell" window, from the window, click "File", then click "Open" from the Toolbar(top of the Window) to open the Simple Game and navigate to the pygame program to open it. The program will open in another window, separate to the Python shell.
Before running the programme, make sure that the Pygame program and all the images (ee.g player, enemies, and the prize) are in the same folder because the programme will not run if they are in different folders.
To run the Simple Game, click "Run" on the Toolbar on top. The screen will then appear and you can move the player to start playing
Enjoy! Make sure you win the prize and beat the enemies
